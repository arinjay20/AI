'''Question: Simulate medical test results to estimate the probability that a patient actually has a
disease if their test is positive for 10000 patients.
The conditions are:
• 1% disease rate (rare disease).
• Test detects disease correctly in 95% of diseased patients (true positive rate).
• Test falsely alarms in 5% of healthy patients (false positive rate).
Algorithm: Probability Estimation using Bayes’ Theorem (Simulation)
Input:
• Disease prevalence (P(D)) = 0.01
• True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) = 0.95
• False Positive Rate = 0.05
• Number of patients to simulate = 10,000
Output:
Estimated probability P(Disease | Test Positive)'''
